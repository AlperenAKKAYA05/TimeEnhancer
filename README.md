# General information

Time Enhancer and Time Enhancer are two applications developed to play games on your Steam accounts. The two programs run differently - depending on whether you are idle, you may want to choose one of them. Both applications do not require you to have the game you want to increase, but the game must be in your own library.


## Time Enhancer

This program acts as a standalone Steam client and will require you to enter your steam account details. The advantages of this applet are that you can keep multiple accounts idle in one place and that Steam does not need to be installed on the computer you are running, which means you can rent a VPS and keep working for weeks. For this reason, if you are looking for multiple accounts at the same time in accounts you do not use, this is ideal for you. However, if you use only one account, and you want to be online, play another game, or chat with your friends, this does not work very well because you can not log in to both locations at the same time. If you want this feature, scroll down and read about Time Enhancer. Time Enhancer has no option to trade cards. If you are looking for this feature, check out Time Enhancer.


## Time Enhancer

If you have an account that you want to upgrade, this program is the perfect program for you. This program requires you to install Steam, but at the same time with Time Enhancer, you can enter your account, play games and chat with your friends, while boosting other games. Time Enhancer also offers a great way to farm Trade Cards.
