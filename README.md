# General information

Time Enhancer and Time Enhancer Game is two applications developed to play on your Steam accounts. The two programs work differently - depending on whether they are idle, you may want to choose one of them. Both applications do not require the game you want to increase, but the game must be in your own library. TimeEnhancer.Game.exe is the second application and allows use in console mode.

## Time Enhancer

If you have an account that you want to upgrade, this program is the perfect program for you. This program requires you to install Steam, but at the same time with Time Enhancer, you can enter your account, play games and chat with your friends, while boosting other games. Time Enhancer also offers a great way to farm Trade Cards.
